									My name is Dylan Fois, my student number is S3786185 and my personal email is dylanfois1@gmail.com. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria on the 20th of July 2000. My background is Italian as both of my parents were born in Italy. An interesting fact about me is that I play a few instruments, including violin, piano and electric guitar, and I use a computer program in order to practice on the guitar. In 2006 I started primary school at Brunswick South West Primary school, and graduated at the end of 2012. I then went on to Secondary education at Strathmore Secondary College in 2013, graduating in 2018 with an ATAR of 87.20.  I am now enrolled at RMIT University on the city campus, studying Bachelor of Information Technology.

									My interest in IT began in the late 2000's, when my family had an old beige computer running Windows XP. It was our personal computer. My uncle had installed an arcade game emulator known as "MAME" which was used to emulate classic arcade games such as Galaga, Street Fighter Alpha, 1944 - The Loop Master etc. After this, I began tinkering and experimenting with computers both on a software and hardware level.
 I eventually started taking my computer apart and putting it back together until I knew how it worked, and then went on to build my own computer, as well as building computers for friends that were getting into the hobby. I then started to get into overclocking my system components, such as my RAM, GPU and CPU, which further pushed me into the world of IT. I started experimenting with liquid cooling in order to get as high an overclock as possible, which helped my understanding of overclocking and computers in general grow immensely.

I chose to come to RMIT University because it had a range of IT based courses that I wanted to do, such as Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Computer Science, however, I also chose RMIT based on its location, as it is located just after Melbourne Central Station, and therefore was convenient for me to get to university as it is only a 20 minute train ride to RMIT. Furthermore, a lot of my high school friends go to RMIT, which further pushed me to go to RMIT as I would still be able to see all my friends.

I expect to learn many things during my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to dive further into the world of software as I have good knowledge of the hardware side of IT, but not as much knowledge of software, as my focus in the IT hobby has always been mainly hardware sided. I also expect to further my knowledge of he hardware side of IT, such as setting up networks, servers, etc. I am also interested in pursuing a major in Cloud computing, so if I go down that route, I expect to learn about topics related to cloud computing or even AI.

This is a Cloud Network Engineer position from Amazon Web Services, which involves working with clients and the developer community in order to troubleshoot and solve problems based on networking and the cloud, and assisting companies set up services related to the cloud and aiding in running their necessary applications. This position interests me as I have always enjoyed troubleshooting and solving IT related problems for others, so being able to work with a large company like AWS helping clients set up cloud and networking related services and applications appeals to me. Although I am inexperienced in the network and cloud related areas, I am interested in those areas and am willing to learn more about them to see whether it would be ideal for me.

This position requires either 4+ years of experience in a technical position, or a Bachelors degree of Information Technology, Computer Science, Engineering or a related field. Furthermore, the listing goes on to list many qualifications needed for this position, such as configuring and troubleshooting VPN software, proficiency in network administration, understanding of hardware and software load balancing in data centres, and administration experience on either Linux/Unix, or Windows.

Currently, I do not have many skills related to this position, I do have good written and oral communication skills, however, I only have very basic programming skills from my Intro to Programming course, and I am also only just starting the 1st year of my Bachelor of IT, so although I am working towards having a bachelor of IT qualification, I currently do not have it as of yet. I do also have a basic understanding of firewall concepts and rules but definitely not enough for this position.

My plan to obtain the skills and qualifications necessary would be to first find a beginner position related to IT, in order to begin gaining real world experience of a position in IT, which would progress my skills related to IT as well as general knowledge of the IT field. Next, I will complete my Bachelor of IT, which will hopefully teach me the majority or a good portion of the skills needed to be qualified for this position, such as experience in networking and administrating IT systems, as well as topics relating to VPN's and firewalls. I am hoping to progress further with programming during this course, however, a lot of private study will need to be done to be qualified in terms of programming. Any other skills and qualifications needed, I am hoping to obtain through progressing through jobs in my IT career, or through private study, or even pursuing certificates from companies such as Microsoft, with their "Microsoft Certified Professional" IT certificate that is used to demonstrate IT abilities.
