									My name is Dylan Fois, my student number is S3786185 and my personal email is dylanfois1@gmail.com. I was born in Melbourne, Victoria on the 20th of July 2000. My background is Italian as both of my parents were born in Italy. An interesting fact about me is that I play a few instruments, including violin, piano and electric guitar, and I use a computer program in order to practice on the guitar. In 2006 I started primary school at Brunswick South West Primary school, and graduated at the end of 2012. I then went on to Secondary education at Strathmore Secondary College in 2013, graduating in 2018 with an ATAR of 87.20.  I am now enrolled at RMIT University on the city campus, studying Bachelor of Information Technology.

									My interest in IT began in the late 2000's, when my family had an old beige computer running Windows XP. It was our personal computer. My uncle had installed an arcade game emulator known as "MAME" which was used to emulate classic arcade games such as Galaga, Street Fighter Alpha, 1944 - The Loop Master etc. After this, I began tinkering and experimenting with computers both on a software and hardware level. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I eventually started taking my computer apart and putting it back together until I knew how it worked, and then went on to build my own computer, as well as building computers for friends that were getting into the hobby. I then started to get into overclocking my system components, such as my RAM, GPU and CPU, which further pushed me into the world of IT. I started experimenting with liquid cooling in order to get as high an overclock as possible, which helped my understanding of overclocking and computers in general grow immensely. </p>

<p> I chose to come to RMIT University because it had a range of IT based courses that I wanted to do, such as Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Computer Science, however, I also chose RMIT based on its location, as it is located just after Melbourne Central Station, and therefore was convenient for me to get to university as it is only a 20 minute train ride to RMIT. Furthermore, a lot of my high school friends go to RMIT, which further pushed me to go to RMIT as I would still be able to see all my friends. </p>

<p> I expect to learn many things during my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to dive further into the world of software as I have good knowledge of the hardware side of IT, but not as much knowledge of software, as my focus in the IT hobby has always been mainly hardware sided. I also expect to further my knowledge of he hardware side of IT, such as setting up networks, servers, etc. I am also interested in pursuing a major in Cloud computing, so if I go down that route, I expect to learn about topics related to cloud computing or even AI.

This is a Cloud Network Engineer position from Amazon Web Services, which involves working with clients and the developer community in order to troubleshoot and solve problems based on networking and the cloud, and assisting companies set up services related to the cloud and aiding in running their necessary applications. This position interests me as I have always enjoyed troubleshooting and solving IT related problems for others, so being able to work with a large company like AWS helping clients set up cloud and networking related services and applications appeals to me. Although I am inexperienced in the network and cloud related areas, I am interested in those areas and am willing to learn more about them to see whether it would be ideal for me. </p>
<p>

This position requires either 4+ years of experience in a technical position, or a Bachelors degree of Information Technology, Computer Science, Engineering or a related field. Furthermore, the listing goes on to list many qualifications needed for this position, such as configuring and troubleshooting VPN software, proficiency in network administration, understanding of hardware and software load balancing in data centres, and administration experience on either Linux/Unix, or Windows. </p>
<p>

Currently, I do not have many skills related to this position, I do have good written and oral communication skills, however, I only have very basic programming skills from my Intro to Programming course, and I am also only just starting the 1st year of my Bachelor of IT, so although I am working towards having a bachelor of IT qualification, I currently do not have it as of yet. I do also have a basic understanding of firewall concepts and rules but definitely not enough for this position. </p>
<p>

My plan to obtain the skills and qualifications necessary would be to first find a beginner position related to IT, in order to begin gaining real world experience of a position in IT, which would progress my skills related to IT as well as general knowledge of the IT field. Next, I will complete my Bachelor of IT, which will hopefully teach me the majority or a good portion of the skills needed to be qualified for this position, such as experience in networking and administrating IT systems, as well as topics relating to VPN's and firewalls. I am hoping to progress further with programming during this course, however, a lot of private study will need to be done to be qualified in terms of programming. Any other skills and qualifications needed, I am hoping to obtain through progressing through jobs in my IT career, or through private study, or even pursuing certificates from companies such as Microsoft, with their "Microsoft Certified Professional" IT certificate that is used to demonstrate IT abilities.

									On the Myers-Briggs personality test, my personality type was "Defender". In the mid category, I scored 88% Introverted as opposed to extraverted. In the energy category, I scored 58% observant as opposed to Intuitive. On the nature category I received 72% feeling rather than thinking, in Tactics i received 64% judging rather than prospecting and finally in the identity category I received 75% turbulent rather than assertive.
The result of the learning style test showed that I am a visual learner, with 45% visual, 35% Auditory and 20% tactile.
On a creativity test, I scored 62/100 for openness to creativity.

								</p>

<p> These results don't mean too much to me, as although I am generally introverted and not as creative as others, once I am in a group and I get to know the other members, I can become more extroverted within that group and once faced with ideas from other team members, I can start to become more creative based on what others have been doing.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The results for the personality test may hinder my ability to work in a team, as I am generally very introverted, however, the results for the learning styles test would aid my ability to work in a team, as I like to learn off other people and how they solve their problems, and potentially even show teammates how I would solve a problem. My creativity test result may hinder my ability to work in a team though, as I generally prefer to be given a task that I am already capable of completing, rather than needing to be creative in thinking up a way to solve problems.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I would take this into account when forming a team by selecting group members who are generally more extroverted and creative, which will enable our team to be counter-balanced with creativity and logic, as well as having an easier time talking to one another about ideas, as lots of introverted people may make for a hard time in terms of showing the group ideas. I would also ensure the members are potentially more visual based learners so it is easier for the whole team to learn one way, rather than needing a different approach for each member, which could slow down productivity.

								<h3> <b> Overview </b> </h3>
                                                                <p> My project idea involves creating a game centred around cars and automobiles in general. 
It would involve high levels of detail surrounding creation and assembly of vehicles, such as in-depth creation and tuning of engines of different types,
 as well as in-depth creation and tuning of suspension parts, and then allow you to test your car and race it against others. By having many parts available to the user,
 they are able to create and modify a vehicle to make it unique to themselves not only including the exterior appearance of the vehicle,
 but also the internal functionality such as high-performance engines, drift, race, drag suspension etc. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3> <b> Motivation </b> </h3>
<p> 
Currently as of March 2019, there are only 2 games that fit this model, one being released in 2003, called Street Legal Racing Redline. Although still popular,
 the game is extremely outdated and runs poorly on modern hardware. The other game that fits this model is called Street Tuning Evolution, which was first brought into conception in 2015,
 but has yet to be completed and still has not reached alpha stages. There is a huge player-base for the original 2003 game, yet no major game studio and publisher have attempted to break into this market.
 With modern technology, a modern version of this game would satisfy the demands of many users.
</p>
<p> </p>

<h3> <b> Description </b> </h3>
<p> The game would make use of many individual parts of vehicles in order to allow the user to build their vehicle. Parts would be split up into separate groups for different sections of the car,
 such as a category for engine parts, which would be further categorised into sub-categories such as engine blocks, engine heads, fuel delivery, air delivery etc, which would each contain parts relating to that group,
 for example, the air delivery category would have parts such as carburettors, air filters, intake manifolds etc, while a performance parts category would host parts such as turbochargers, superchargers, nitrous oxide systems etc.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
The one game that is currently on the market, SLRR, only has one way to earn money, which is street-racing. This limits gameplay and can make the game become boring and repetitive after time, causing users to stop playing.
 My project idea would incorporate many different race types, such as official racing, eg circuit racing on official tracks such as Bathurst or Spa, along with drift type events, as well as street racing,
 which allows users the opportunity to customise a car to compete in the events that they prefer, and also gives motive for the user to continue playing, so as to develop 3 separate cars for each different racing discipline.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
The original game also did not include any form of multiplayer, meaning the users were stuck to only playing against AI. By incorporating multiplayer into my project, this opens up a range of new features that could be implemented into the game, 
such as having free roam amongst other users to look at each-others cars, and race one another or even host events such as a circuit race, drift events, or street races, which would give the users the ability to compete with others to see who has built the fastest machine. 
This further increases motive to play so as to create a vehicle that is faster than everyone else's. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
A system of buying pre-owned vehicles would need to be set-up, which would be at the start of the game and makes the suer start off with a slow car, before being able to race and buy performance parts to win more races and earn more money. After this, the user may use the online multiplayer
 feature to use an auction house, which would allow users to put their cars on auction and buy other players vehicles, potentially at discounted prices if the vehicles have been written off or are damaged. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
The game would also employ a full damage model, in order to simulate engine wear and tear, as well as body parts crumpling from crashes and suspension components being destroyed. This means the user will need to be careful when racing in order to preserve the condition 
of their car to continue racing it, and means users cannot just put a turbocharger on a vehicle and turn the boost up to the maximum possible, as this will destroy the engine and set the user back.								
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> <b> Tools & Technologies </b> </h3>
<p>
In order to produce this game, a game engine would be needed. My project would most likely make use of the Unity engine due to it being free, however, it may need to be modified in order to accommodate some of the features of my project, such as a damage model and multiplayer. 
A modelling software would also need to be used to create the models of every engine, suspension and vehicle component available, as well as the vehicles themselves. This could be done using Blender, as it is also free software and easy to use.								
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> <b> Skills Required </b> </h3>
<p>
Knowledge on programming and game development will be essential in order to create the game, along with knowledge and experience with modelling, as each individual part of the engine, suspension and chassis will need to be modelled. 
The computers used to create these models would also need to be high-end machines in order to render models in a timely manner (eg high end consumer i7 processors, 6+ cores) The feasibility of gathering all the talent is high, however, many people with these skills would need to 
be employed in order to keep production time low, this coupled with the need for several high-end desktops for programming and rendering models would drive costs up very high, meaning a large amount of money would be needed to fund this project.	
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> <b> Outcome </b> </h3>
If this project were to be successful, many people would be able to enjoy a modern equivalent of the 2003 SLRR, which is still widely played today due to its high customisation of vehicles, thereby solving the problem of having to play the outdated game. 
This will potentially have a large impact on not only the gaming industry, but also car enthusiasts, as they will be able to visualise upgrades to their vehicles in the game before they purchase them for their real car, allowing them to see if they like it before-hand.
